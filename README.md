# Tobacco Effect

In this research study, we are aimed to investigate the impact of different parameters on the usage of tobacco in different countries.

This is a data science project without any socio-economic study behind that. Our results will show the impact of parameters on tobacco usage.

We start with 3 data sets including data about "ban on advertising tobacco", "countries' economic situation" and "tobacco usage in countries", and try to find the impact first and second parameters on tobacco usage as the result.

Problem definition: "*Which parameters among all detected have more impact on tobacco usage in different countries*?"
